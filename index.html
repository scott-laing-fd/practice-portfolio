    <h2>Summary</h2>
    <p>
      My career as a professional software engineer (since 2014) has had a focus
      on front-end, mostly Android app/sdk development. I have a keen interest
      in keeping up-to-date with the latest relevant software patterns,
      especially those around reactive designs and declarative UI. For personal
      projects, I've also dabbled a bit with Google-backed Flutter
      cross-platform UI framework, including building <em>not</em> this web
      portfolio!
    </p>
    <h2>Education</h2>
    <b>2007 - 2010</b>
    <h3>DipHE Software Engineering: Edinburgh Napier University</h3>
    <p>
      Few years of full time study built some of the foundations for my software
      engineering career. Started on a multimedia technology degree but switched
      to Software Engineering. Two years of study leaving with the equivalent of
      a DipHE.
    </p>
    <h3>BSc (Hon) Open: The Open University</h3>
    <b>2014 - 2018</b>
    <p>
      Continued formal study whilst continuing with internship and full-time
      work. Studied an Open degree, allowing for free selection of modules,
      choosing modules to further my software engineering career. The modules
      selected were titled Software Development with Java, Software Engineering,
      Fundamentals of Interaction Design, Developing Concurrent Distributed
      Systems, and Data Management and Analysis.
