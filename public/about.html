    <h2>About Scott</h2>
    <p>My name is Scott Laing - welcome to my digital space where I'll share with you a little about me.</p>
    <p>I'm a ritualistic coffee drinker and am originally from Fife, Scotland. Like many computer nerds, I enjoy playing computer games and have done since childhood. Typically I'll go for an FPS (currently Hell Let Loose), but also partial to a strategy game. In fact, it's one of the elements I love about HLL, I can jump in as a Squad Leader or even Commander if I want to dabble in tactics or strategy of it!</p>
    <p>For a number of years now I've had an interest in American football, supporting the NFL's Pittsburgh Steelers as well as a local amateur team (when I can and when they're at home) - the Edinburgh Wolves.</p>
